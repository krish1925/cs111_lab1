## Pipe UpÂ 
In this lab, we develop a sophisticated program that processes command line arguments, which emulates the pipe function in Linux by managing file descriptors through open, close, and redirect operations.

## Building

To build this program, you need to execute the makefile in the directory by running it in terminal. 
Open terminal, navigate to the directory where the files are located, and then run the command: make
this would run the makefile with the specific Cflags and FDflags, creating another executable file pipe which we would use to run our commands in a pipeline

## Running

to run this executable file pipe, we write the command ./pipe [command1] [command2] .....[command n], and run this in the terminal. if there are any errors with the piping, or syntax errors, it would send errors and would write that to the terminal and would return with non zero exit status
for instance, the command : 
./pipe ls sort 
will list all of the files and folders in the current directory in a sorted manner. If you want to pipe more commands, just add them to the end with a space seperator

## Cleaning up

To clean up all other file that were generated using the make, we just run the command in terminal: make clean. This would remove all files generated by the make
